    "# The early Universe\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the observations, the Universe is expanding today. Extrapolating backwards, this implies that the scale factor of the Universe must be quite small in the past. The radiation energy density scales as $\\rho_{\\rm rad} \\propto a^{-4}$. It must be the dominating source of energy density in the Early Universe, dominating over matter, $\\Lambda$ as well as the curvature. During this radiation dominated era, the temperature of the Universe would be determined by the properties of radiation. Assuming a black body nature for this radiation with temperature $T$, and assuming that physical constants of the Universe such as the radiation constant do not depend upon time, $\\rho_{\\rm rad} = 4(\\sigma/c)T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Boltzmann constant. Combining the behaviour of the radiation energy density with the scale factor and its behaviour with the temperature, we obtain the relation between temperature and the scale factor, $T \\propto a^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The temperature of the Universe is thus inversely proportional to the scale factor, which implies that the Universe had a higher temperature at earlier epochs. Given that in the radiation dominated era, $a \\propto t^{1/2}$ where $t$ is the time, we obtain a relation between temperature and time $T \\propto t^{-1/2}$. \n",

    "In the earliest time in the Universe, when the temperature was of the order of $10^{16} {\\rm K} \\sim 1 {\\rm TeV}$, the Universe was full of elementary particles in the standard model, all in thermal equilibrium because of the high rate of interactions. The particle production and annihilation processes operate in equilibrium to keep a steady state abundance ($na^3$) of these particles. However as the temperature of the Universe fell due to the expansion, the production rate is not able to keep up with the annihilation rate. These changes typically happen at a temperature corresponding to the rest mass of the particles $mc^2 \\sim k_{\\rm B}T$. The top quark ($m \\sim 173.07$ GeV/$c^2$) started to annihilate with its antiparticle at around $t \\sim 10^{-11}-10^{-12}s$. Given the mass hierarchy in the standard model, all the particle species annihilate one after the other (muons), leaving a trace amount of protons, neutrons, electrons and neutrinos. The reason why antimatter and matter had a small asymmetry (the baryon asymmetry problem) is a topic of intense research which we will not get into.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider the epoch in the Universe when it was hot enough to have free neutrons and protons around, alongwith radiation. These protons and neutrons would eventually get together to form heavier nuclei. The hot radiation prevents the formation of nuclei, however the Universe cools down as it expands, and then it becomes possible for the heavy nuclei to form. The radiation from the Universe's hot past, would have expanded by now and cooled down, but should still be visible. In 1965, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation by Arnos Penzias and Robert Wilson, which follows the blackbody curve has bolstered the idea of this hot and dense past of the Universe which was in thermodynamic equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different constituents of the Universe interact with each other and radiation via their standard model interactions. If we assume that thermal equilibrium holds, we can write down the distribution functions for any particular species. The distribution function gives the number of particles which have a momentum $|\\vec{p}| \\pm d{p}/2$. For a species X in thermal equlibirum, the distribution function is given by\n",

    "The chemical potential for photons is zero (as they can be added or subtracted) without any change to the free energy. The chemical potentials of pairs of particles and antiparticles are opposite in sign to each other, as they can annihilate and create photons. The chemical potentials are dependent upon the number densities of these particles. The ratio of the number density of baryons to photons is quite small today ($\\sim 10^{-8}-10^{-9}$). This ratio is constant as both the number densities fall as $a^{-3}$. The lepton density is also small, and so all the chemical potentials can be assumed to be close to zero and negligible. \n",

    "## Total effective degrees of freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending upon the temperature of the Universe we can compute the total effective degrees of freedom in all relativistic species and write down the relationship between the energy density of radiation which is driving the expansion and the temperature. For example, at very very high temperatures when all the standard model particles are relativistic, and are present in equilibrium quantities, we have 90 fermionic degrees of freedom and 28 bosonic degrees of freedom. For number densities, we have $28 + 3/4\\times 90 = 95.5$ effective degrees of freedom, for energy densities, pressures, and entropy that number is $28 + 7/8\\times 90=106.75$. That allows us to write the relations between the energy density versus temperature. As the temperature drops several particles start to annihilate, depending upon the masses of the different standard model particles. Thus their number densities will start to change as the temperature. These changes happen at specific temperatures in the Universe corresponding to the masses of the standard model particles.\n",

    "## Particle freeze out\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have different species in the Universe, depending upon their masses they will go between these relativistic and non-relativistic limits. Importantly once the temperature of the Universe drops below $m_{\\rm X}c^2/k_{\\rm B}$, the abundance, and the related quantities quickly undergo an exponential drop. In the radiation dominated era, the expansion of the Universe is controlled by the species that are relativistic. Once they become non-relativistic their relevance becomes less to the expansion of the Universe in the radiation dominated era. This continues until the particles remain in thermal equilibrium, and the creation and annihiliation reactions can still happen against the backdrop of an expanding Universe. Once the expansion time scale of the Universe becomes smaller compared to the annihilation rates, the abundance of particles gets frozen in, and they just fall off as $a^{-3}$. \n",

    "## Temperature of a decoupled relativistic species\n",

    "We have seen that the total entropy $a^3s(T)$ in the Universe stays constant. However the entropy density $s(T) \\propto g^{*}_{s}T^3$. Thus we obtain that $g^*_{s}a^3 T^3 =$ constant. When the effective degrees of freedom goes down the temperature will decrease at a slower fashion than it would normally do due to expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be understood in the following fashion: at high temperatures particles and antiparticles annihilate and dump energy into the radiation (or lower mass particles). However the particle pair production process causes the opposite to happen and an equilibrium is maintained. However as the temperature falls, the pair production gets affected. Pair annihilations continue to dump energy in to the relativistic sector. This is the reason why the temperature drop become slower during the time when pair annihilation processes take place."

    "Let us consider a particle species like neutrino which decouples when it is relativistic. It happens when the temperature drops below $800$ keV. In this case it has its own temperature (which continues to decrease as $1/a$. This temperature is the same as the rest of the particles (electrons, positrons and photons) even after the neutrinos have decoupled (just because both the temperatures continue to fall at the same rate). However, at temperatures close to $511$ keV, the electron-positron pair annihilations start to take place. This will cause the temperature of the photons to drop slower than the usual $1/a$ as the electron-positron pair starts to annihilate and dump the energy in to photons.

    "\n",
    "The cosmic microwave background was discovered by Arnos Penzias and Robert Wilson in 1965, work for which they received the Nobel Prize in Physics. This is a remarkable achievement, the existence of this relic radiation from the Universe's hot past was predicted by Gamow and colleagues even before it was observed (there was a large uncertainty about the exact temperature though). There was a huge experimental effort to detect fluctuations in the CMB, but to no avail. Without fluctuations you cannot form all the structure that we see in the Universe today. This non-existence of detectable fluctuations remained a conundrum for a few decades before observational progress made it possible to observe the fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation was measured by the COBE satellite in 1990s. The spectrum is shown below along with a fit to a black body spectrum. The figure does not have any visible errorbars because the errors are smaller than the thickness of the line!\n",
    "\n",
    "![CMB spectrum](images/CMBspectrum.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with these measurements, the COBe team was able to make a detailed map of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background. The figure below shows the temperature measurement in the top plot as a function of position on the sky, the middle panel shows the residual after removing the monopole component, and shows the dominant dipole fluctuation due to the motion of galaxy with respect to the CMB frame/ The bottom panel shows the residual fluctuations after both the monopole and dipole are subtracted out.\n",

    "First notice the degree to which the CMB is isotropic, the temperature scale is in Kelvin in the top panel, millikelvin in the middle panel and microkelvin in the bottom. The CMB fluctuations are extremely tiny of the order $10^{-5}$ of the monopole. These fluctuations are our earliest look at the fluctuations which caused the formation of structure in the Universe.\n",
    "\n",
    "These fluctuations tell us a lot of information about the Universe. We will make an attempt to understand the most basic information given by the fluctuations of the CMB. As we have seen before, the CMB is relic radiation belonging to an era when the baryons and photons were tightly coupled with each other. As the temperature dropped the electrons could no longer be ionized from hydrogen atoms, and the photons started to stream freely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try to understand how big would be the typical size of a fluctuation in the CMB. To understand this we need to understand how fluctuations behave in the baryon photon plasma. Recall that the pressure and density of relativistic photons are related as $p = \\rho c^2/3$. Thus the speed of any pressure density fluctuations in photons and any matter coupled with radiation will be close to $c_{\\rm s}^2 = dp/d\\rho \\approx c/3$. There are small corrections to this equation due to the non-zero fraction of baryon to photon energy density, but let us neglect it for the moment. Any pressure-density perturbations in the plasma will propagate with the sound speed in the plasma. These fluctuations will begin to travel from the moment they were created to the moment the baryons lose their coupling with the photons (which happens at recombination). \n",

    "The geometry of the Universe as observed today is pretty close to flat. To observe that this is quite a coincidence, note that today the densities in the Universe have to be finely tuned such that the difference between the sum of the matter density, the dark energy density and the radiation energy density (let us call this sum $\\rho$) is equal to the critical density within less than a percent.

This implies that the total energy density of the Universe will have to be incredibly fine tuned in the very early Universe to be close to critical if it has to be equal to the critical density within a percent today.\n",

    "Consider cosmic microwave background photons arriving from opposite direction in the sky. These photons are just arriving today at our location. So the regions which emitted these photons should not have been in causal contact with each other in the very early Universe. Given this it is difficult to understand how these photons manage to have the same temperature to 1 part in 100000?\n",

    "-- Compute the comoving distance to the horizon at the time the cosmic microwave background photons were released. Most of the time spent in the early Universe is in the matter dominated era. The CMB photons were released about 380000 years after the big bang. Hint: Use the formula for the scale factor as a function of time in matter dominated era and the definition of the comoving horizon distance.\n",

    "## Inflation as a solution\n",
    "\n",
    "An epoch of an exponential expansion in the early Universe has been invoked as a solution to these problems. The comoving horizon distance in a Universe which undergoes an exponential expansion, is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\chi &= \\int_{0}^t c \\frac{dt}{a(t)} \\\\\n",
    "&= \\int_{0}^{t} e^{-H_0 t} c dt\\\\\n",
    "&= \\frac{c}{H_0} \\left[1 - e^{-H_0 t}\\right]\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "The exponential will die down fairly quickly if inflation lasts many e-folds. The comoving horizon thus does not grow significantly during periods of exponential expansion. However the physical distances grow exponentially. Thus distances which are in causal contact, can be stretched to distances larger than the comoving horizon during the period of inflation. Inflation thus solves the horizon problem, by positing that the entire observable Universe was once part of a causal patch, which grew exponentially during the early inflationary epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inflation can also solve the fine tuning problem. Note that during inflationary epoch the energy density will stay constant. Thus the quantity $\\delta\\rho/\\rho$ where $\\delta\\rho$ is the difference between the critical density and the density of the Universe can decay exponentially. Inflation drives the Universe towards the critical density.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inflation also is able to provide a solution to the non-existence of magnetic monopoles (such monopoles are regular features in quantum theories of the early Universe). Such monopoles get diluted exponentially during the inflationary epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly inflation also provides an explanation for the seeds of structure formation. The quantum fluctuations in the early Universe can get stretched to scales beyond the horizon during inflation and result in structure formation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inflation is posited to happen due to a scalar field called the inflaton which exists in the early Universe. The inflaton field has an energy density and pressure which can be computed by starting from an action. \n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\rho &= \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{\\phi}^2 + V(\\phi) \\\\\n",
    "p &= \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{\\phi}^2 - V(\\phi) \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $V(\\phi)$ is the potential which governs the dynamics of the inflaton field. The field is homogeneous in the Universe, but is expected to have quantum fluctuations at different locations in the Universe. If the field is static or rolling slowly ($\\dot{\\phi}^2<< 2 V(\\phi)$), then we get an equation of state $p=-\\rho$. We have previously seen that this corresponds to an exponential expansion of the scale factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different potentials which have been proposed, but most inflationary models these days will show a potential which has a false vacuum at $\\phi=0$ with a finite $V(0)$. This potential drives the inflation as the field rolls slowly towards the true minima. Once it reaches the minimum, then the inflaton can decay into radiation and particles in a mechanism called reheating."
